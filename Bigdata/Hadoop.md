# Hadoop & 

### **What is Big Data**
- Big data is when the size of the data itself becomes part of the problem
- Not every company will benefit from Big Data, it depends on your size and your ability
- Everything we do is increasingly leaving a digital trace which we can use and analyse


### **Hadoop**
- programming models to process large data sets
- be written in Java
- built on Hadoop clusters, which are collections of computers or notes, that work together to execute computations on data


##### Principles
- Scale-Out rather than Scale-Up
- Bring code to data rather than data to code
- Abstract complexity of distributed and concurrent application
- Self managing
- Auto parallel processing
