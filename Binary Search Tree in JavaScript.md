 Every parent nodes has at most two children, every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent and every node to the right of the parent node is always greater than the parent.
binary search tree has a **root**, the top node (just one node), **parent** node has at most two **children** nodes, which are called **siblings**. The **edge** is the connection between one node and another. The node without children is called **leaf**.

Binary search tree is ordered/sorted data structure, upon insertion, the nodes are placed in an orderly fashion. This inherent order makes searching fast.
